## What is Toki Musi?

Toki Musi ("fun language") is a melody-based language that you can whistle, sing, or play on an instrument. It is a whistled language port of Toki Pona, with some additional words and grammatical features.

## Relationship to Toki Pona

Toki Musi is built on the foundation of [Toki Pona](http://tokipona.org/), a minimalist constructed language created by Sonja Lang. Toki Pona is famous for having only about 140 words and focusing on simplicity (the name "Toki Pona" itself means "good language" or "simple language" in the language).

While Toki Musi preserves the vocabulary and grammatical structure of Toki Pona, it transforms the language into musical notes, allowing it to be communicated through whistling, singing, or playing musical instruments.

## Whistled Language

Toki Musi joins a global tradition of whistled languages, which exist on nearly every continent:

- **Silbo Gomero** from the Canary Islands is perhaps the most well-known whistled language, developed by shepherds to communicate across steep hillsides
- Whistled languages typically evolved in mountainous regions or dense forests where traditional speech couldn't carry far enough

Unlike natural whistled languages that often encode existing spoken languages (like Silbo Gomero whistling Spanish), Toki Musi was purposely designed as a musical language with:

- A range of 14 semitones (just over an octave) to accommodate the average human whistle range
- Gliding techniques (continuous movement between notes) to represent grammatical features like past tense and questions
- Musical patterns that can be recognized by anyone with a basic "musical ear"
