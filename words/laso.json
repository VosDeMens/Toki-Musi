    "description": "green, in toki pona laso can also mean blue, but pls one of them is the colour of a plant and the other one of the sky. fun fact, in a way the plants are mostly made from the sky, and from water, which is also blue, but as far as i know that's not why plants are green. i understand that which colours we distinguish between is very cultural and some languages don't have a separate word for blue vs green but let's treat ourselves. these colour words are fun to come up with, and btw if i forget to write this down anywhere else, all of this is optional, you're learning a language that you can whistle, which is pretty crazy that you're even reading this, so make it your own, and change it any which way, and come up with new colours, and use other melodies of songs for things if you don't like any of these songs, but if you don't know them listen to them, they mean a lot to me, and you learning this also means a lot to me. in fact i was hoping that you in particular would end up here. i would like to know one thing about you, which i've started asking people recently and i've had a lot of fun with it, and it tells you a lot about a person and since you're interested in musical hearing, whistling or otherwise playing a melodic instrument, and recreationally learning weird languages, i wonder what kind of person you are, so if you were to compete in some activity with a random selection of about 100 people, that you needed to win, but you also get to choose what the activity is, no weird party tricks allowed or you can bend your thumb backwards or whatever quirk, but like something meaningfully skillful, what would you choose? so yea if you can figure out a way to reach me then by all means get in touch. also if you're Jacob Collier, i hoped this day would come, i don't wanna get aheaad of myself and i'm ok to take things slow but i think we should be friends",
