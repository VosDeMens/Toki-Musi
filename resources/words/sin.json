        "M\u00e1irt\u00edn O'Connor - Into The New (opening melody) (during the process of assigning melodies to all of these words i was surprised to see how popular 0:4:7:9 is. there are so many songs i considered using for words with this melody, like Little Blue by Jacob Collier, And So It Goes by Billy Joel, True Colors by Cyndi Lauper, and most of them also for words that are used more in toki pona than sin but i just lov M\u00e1irt\u00edn O'Connor so much and this whole album The Road West is so dear to me. Maybe it's just that i grew up listening to it but i can't seem to find people this album evokes the emotional response for that it does for me. Hit me up if you're M\u00e1irt\u00edn O'Connor pilled pls <3"
