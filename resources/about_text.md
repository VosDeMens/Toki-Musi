## ðŸ¦Š Hello

\$\$\$

My name is Vos. I can often feel overwhelmed, but I'm almost never bored. When I'm not obessively hobbying, I'm probably out doing this. That's me on the front.
I am passionate about a lot of things, and I'll list just a few:
- Creating things, whether that's a language you can whistle, music, made-up games, or new ideas for things to create.
- **Thinking** about things, but I also like to *feel* about things as well. I don't think (or feel) those are mutually exclusive.
- Abstract algebra, I'm a sucker for symmetries, shoutout John Conway (RIP). What is your favourite number, or collection of numbers? I'm a big fan of 19. I really like * (star) as well, but you could argue it's not really a number at all. I mean what even IS a *number*. Have you ever thought about that?
- Jumping around, climbing stuff, etc.
- Learning about new things. I like to watch youtube videos.
- Playing chess. Actually I was never really into chess. I thought it had too many rules, and I still kind of do. I like games with around 3 rules, but recently someone suggested to play chess and I caught the bug. Do you wanna play chess?
- Having had a good night of sleep, although sadly I'm not usually as excited about initiating sleep.
- Having \~conversations\~ and \~connections\~ with people. People are one of my favourite parts of life, although I guess there's quite a range of compatibility.
- Generally being like "wtf is going on". Life is confusing, and shit seems to be hitting the fan all around.
- Tandem.
- Nose whistle.

Speaking of, I was gonna show you that nose whistle cover I made. And with that, I think that's enough about me for now. If you want more about me, I'm on Instagram, YouTube (evidently) and Spotify, and <span style="pointer-events: none;">Chess.com</span>, all of which you can find links to through my <a href="https://linktr.ee/kidontherun" style="color:#FF0000;">LinkTree</a>.

### Toki Pona

Credit where it's due, TM (Toki Musi) is barely its own language. If you're familiar with other conlangs (constructed languages), the name Toki Musi might remind you of Toki Pona. For everyone else: <a href="http://tokipona.org/" style="color:#FF0000;">Toki Pona</a> is a conlang designed by Sonja Lang, and developed further by the Toki Pona community. Toki Pona is famous (nerd famous) for only having up to about 140 words, depending on which ones you decide to need exactly. Toki Musi is, in a sense, a port of Toki Pona to melody, but it has some additional words and grammatical features.
Toki Pona is all about simplicity, the name of the language just means "good language" in the language itself. But `pona` (`good`) could also mean `simple`, or any other word that you feel might fit that semantic category. And `toki` (`language`) could also mean `speech`, or you can use it for `hello`. There is no separate word for `hello`, it's like you run into someone and you just go CONVERSATION. In Toki Musi, `toki pona` sounds like `0:7 0:4`\&

### Silbo Gomero

There are existing whistled languages out in the wild, although it seems a pretty niche subject online. I couldn't find a lot of information on exactly which whistled languages are out there and how they work, but I also didn't try very hard.
If you've heard of any whistled language, it's probably Silbo, from Gomera, one of the Canary Islands. If you want a less abridged account of history, I'm sure you'll be able to find it somewhere, but I'll tell you my version from memory:
It's hard to imagine but there were once no phones, and combining no phones with a very steep hilly landscape lead shepherds to decide they should stop shouting at each other, and start exploring other means of communication. They came up with a genuinely really difficult whistling technique that I tried to practise but really couldn't get whatsoever. They're able to emulate around 8 different consonants with the whistle, and use different pitches to represent different vowel sounds. They're essentially whistling Spanish to each other. It's hard to understand to an untrained ear, especially when you don't speak Spanish, but if you have subtitles you can definitely recognise the words in the whistle. It's astonishly beautiful, and sadly now that there's phones, not as many people bother to learn it anymore, but it seems to be making a comeback.
I know there's a whistled language in Turkey, and there is supposedly at least one on every continent. I don't know much about any of them.

### Vaun and friends

My sister was there with input for the first steps of Toki Musi, and has overall always shown interest in the new developments I made. I also have a very nice collection of friends and/or loved ones, who always celebrate the things I consider accomplishments. I guess a lot of people don't really see the point of a project like this, but over time I have found quite a nice and diverse network, with people who might not entirely relate to my fixations, but help me to not forget that, although unusual, the ways I decide to spend my time are authentic, and genuinely really fun and meaningful to me. I hope you have people like this in your life (or that you're \~normal\~ and it doesn't really matter).

### Streamlit

I almost forgot but I am very grateful to have access to a tool so simple and user friendly and free (and ad free!) as Streamlit. I am not a web developer but this baby is looking slick. Thank you Streamlit, this is really amazing.

## ðŸ˜— Why make a whistled language?

Why not? I always wanted to, but the idea of having to come up with a melody for every word I would want to use always seemed too big of a task. When I was a kid, my father would whistle to me and my sister when we'd run off in the supermarket, and we'd find him back that way: `0:-4:5_:3_:r___:8_:3_:0_:-4_:5_:3_:-9_:1_:0:-2:0_:-4_:-2__`\&. It's the jingle of the local theater. He always whistled the same melody, and I later learned it's not even the exact melody of the theater. You could say my father is negligent for that, but he is also very funny. He never bothered to communicate "Hey while you're out there, could you grab some oranges" by whistling `0:-2 0_:5:2_:-2 - 12\0 0:4:-5_:4 0:0:2:4:5_`\&. Maybe he didn't trust in my abilities, or maybe he was just born in simpler times. I guess every generation brings something new to the table.

## ðŸ¤” How make a whistled language?

I first had the idea together with a friend, in university, but we didn't see it through. Then fast forward to medio 2024, I had a dream that somebody had done it, by just assigning a note to each letter of the alphabet. I was pretty jealous I hadn't thought of that myself, and then I woke up and it turned out that I had kind of tought of it myself? I mean not really, not actively at least, but then again do you ever really actively think something up? Like I'll sometimes sit down and try to remember something, as I tend to forget things left and right, but what am I really doing when I sit there furrowing my brow? I'm like "I'm thinking" but really I'm just kind of waiting for things to pop into my mind.
Anyway, I got up and I implemented this method, and it sounded like random notes, somewhat unsurprisingly. Take for example the sentence "hello how are you doing today": `7:4:11:11:14 7:14:22 0:17:4 24:14:20 3:14:8:13:6 19:14:3:0:24`\&. So then I was like ok at least I didn't think of that myself. I want things that mean something to sound nice, and preferably, things that sound nice to mean something. This is pretty difficult. When I tell people I made a melody based language they're often like oh `7\2\-8/0_/6_ 8_\-4/7\-1_`\& what did I say? And I'm like ok, that's not really how it works though. You're speaking a language with letters, but I can't just go FPHBQYIEMZLGUT and reasonably expect your language to have covered that combination, but fair enough, it would be really cool to have a language that really assigns meaning to all possible melodies. Maybe a future project...
I guess what I wanted to have is a language where the **meaning** is really encoded in the melody, one that doesn't depend on being able to roll an r in your whistle, or to first learn Spanish, although you could apply Silbo's approach to other languages as well. I didn't like that a word's melody would depend on how it's written or pronounced in an already existing language. If these terms mean anything to you, I wanted to choose the melodies based on semantics, not syntax.
Then somebody suggested I look at Toki Pona, and I'd heard of Toki Pona and knew about the basic idea, but I hadn't thought of using it as a place to start, so thank you Jak. I might not have gotten here if it wasn't for your suggestion. I don't even know if you were being serious but thank you regardless.
Then I thought hm ok essentially I just have to choose 140 melodies, and that was a lot more challenging than I thought it would be, but also a lot of fun of course. I went over the words in Toki Pona, assigned the two notes melodies I wanted to use to the most common words, and kind of went from there, and just thought for each word what song do I associate with this semantic category, and then tried to take a melody from that song. It surprised me how little variation there is in melodies in the music I listen to, even though I identify as a lover of unconventional music. This has been a great way to pay homage to all of my favourite artists as well, by incorporating them into the language.
I decided to use Toki Pona, not because I wanted my language to be simple or easy to learn necessarily, which is part of the intention of Toki Pona, but more because it felt like I could actually do this project from there. I am happy to have more than 140 words, and I like to have grammatical features in a language like plural and what not. Toki Pona doesn't have this, and that is entirely fitting for what it's trying to be. I love Toki Pona, and the community that uses it. There's a Discord server where people speak Toki Pona to each other, it's all really really wholesome. I love the passion. There's a lot of things I would change about the world, but I'm very grateful to live in a time where people can come up with their own languages and just have that be one of their activities.
But yea, I guess that's it for my intentions with Toki Musi. If you are keen to try and learn it, head over to the guide!
