And thanks for stopping by! This is a web app dedicated to Toki Musi, a melody based language that you can whistle, sing, or play on an instrument, although depending on the instrument you might need to get creative. This page will contain a short introduction and an outline on how to approach learning Toki Musi.

Credit where it's due, Toki Musi is barely its own language. If you're familiar with other conlangs (constructed languages), the name Toki Musi might remind you of Toki Pona. For everyone else: [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/) is a conlang designed by Sonja Lang, and developed further by the Toki Pona community. Toki Pona is famous (nerd famous) for only having up to about 140 words, depending on which ones you decide to need exactly. Toki Musi is essentially a port of Toki Pona to melody, but it has some additional words and grammatical features. If you're interested in learning Toki Musi, I suggest the following steps:

## Let me [introduce myself](./about) (optional)

At the end of the day this is all about clout. If you're interested in the acknowledgements I'd like to make, or if you have any burning questions, like: Who would want to make a language that you can whistle? Or: There are already whistled languages, why would anyone bother making another one? Or: I wonder if the guy who made this has recently recorded a nose whistle cover of Desert Song by SÃ¤je and uploaded it to YouTube. I guess that's not exactly a question but boi do I have just the link for you.

## Learn Toki Pona

Or at least get familiar with the basic concepts like how to group words, and the grammar in general. You don't need to memorise all the words, although really you might as well. There are excellent free online resources to learn Toki Pona, and I'm sure you'll be able to find some that work well for you, but if you're looking for a recommendation, check out https://mun.la/. What I like about this website is that from the beginning it provides example sentences, it challenges you to try and interpret sentences yourself, and it has nice explanations about why things are the way they are. A lot of other resources I tried left me questioning certain aspects of Toki Pona, and this website answered all of my questions.

## Check out the [guide](./guide)

Where I'll explain in depth how Toki Musi works, referring a lot to how it's simliar to or different from Toki Pona. If you skipped learning Toki Pona because you *simply* **cannot** *wait* to **whistle**, and you think you're *smart* enough to just **learn Toki Musi** without learning Toki Pona first, chances are you're right. I've tried to make the guide as comprehensive as possible, but if you get confused it's never too late to learn Toki Pona.

## Study the [dictionary](./dictionary)

Not how you usually learn a language, but remember the vocabulary is especially slim, and the words are sorted by relevance, so you'll start with the most essential words. The dictionary lets you listen to each word, tells you where the melody came from, and gives you example sentences containing the word, which you can listen to and try to decipher before looking at the transcribed version or the English translation.

## Practise

Involve your friends, preferably, and learn by conversation. But yea I'm aware not everybody has friends that would like to learn a whistled language, so I created a [virtual whistling assistant](./whistle_coach) who **does** understand ~me~ you (most of the time). Actually this was a pretty hard feature to design, but I really wanted to include it and I think it came out *pretty nice*. Apart from learning to **whistle**, we need to learn to *listen*, which you can do in the dictionary, but if you want to listen to random examples and try to decipher them, you can do that [here](./transcribe_coach).

## Give feedback

If you want, you can get in touch with any feedback you might have. You should be able to figure out how to reach me through the [about page](./about). Thanks for being here, and if you're someone who's into creating Discord servers or some other online platform to create a space for people to practise this together then I'm all for it. Also all of this is open source, so if you wanna look at my code, I documented most of it.
