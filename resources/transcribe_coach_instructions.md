They won't bite. Transcribe Coach is here to help you learn to interpret sentences by ear. You will get a random example sentence, and you can try to understand it, and then reveal the written form, and the translation, when you're ready to check your interpretation. This one is a bit less decked out than Whistle Coach, but I felt like this is really all you need.
