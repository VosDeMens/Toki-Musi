Transcribe Coach is here to help you learn to interpret sentences by ear. You will get a random example sentence, and you can try to write out the sentence word by word, in text.

Of course you can go to the dictionary and study the words before doing this exercise, but you can also learn by listening to a sentence and just revealing the answer, whatever works for you.

Writing out words in text can be a bit tricky. There are specific ways to indicate grammatical modifications to a word. Below there's a cheat sheet on how to denote this, but for more information on how the grammar works, check out the guide.

- Vanilla form: [pona]
- Past tense: [pona-ed]
- Plural: [pona-s]
- Comparative: [pona-er]
- Superlative: [pona-est]
- Question: [pona-?]
- Finite verb: [_pona]
- Direct object: [.pona]

If you want to combine modifiers, the order doesn't matter ([pona-ed-?] = [pona-?-ed]).
