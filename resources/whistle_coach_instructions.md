The best way to learn to whistle is by whistling, you can quote me on that. This page is for practising your whistle skills. If you want to really test your abilities, you can record yourself whistling something without announcing what you're going to try to whistle. The Whistle Coach will then try to interpret your whistle, and tell you what it understood (as in convert it to text, not translate it to English). This is pretty hard but lucky for you the Whistle Coach absolutely \~slays\~ at linear algebra, and is currently unemployed.

If you haven't had as much practice whistling, there's no shame in picking a reference sentence, which you can listen to before you attempt to whistle it. You can load a random sentence from the library of reference sentences, but if you know the words and syntax, you can also modify the sentence, or type one from scratch. If there's any text in the reference sentence field when you record your whistle, the Whistle Coach will assume you tried to whistle that sentence.

Things to keep in mind:

- It doesn't matter when exactly you start whistling, you can press record and then wait a couple seconds, and the silence is automatically cut off.

- It doesn't matter in which key you whistle. The Whistle Coach will estimate the key of your sentence, and it will give you feedback in that key.

- It doesn't matter how fast you whistle, as long as you're consistent.

- Try to whistle steadily. The more consistent your volume and timing, the better the results. The beginning and end of a word are determined by your pauses, so be sure to leave some silence between words, and make sure to make short notes short, and long notes long. The Whistle Coach can be quite pedantic, and is here to really drill you on precision. There's a good chance people might be able to understand what you mean from context, but the Whistle Coach doesn't care about context. Often notes that are in the middle of your range will be much louder than notes at the edge of your range, especially low notes. If notes are not detected, practise consistency in volume.

- The Whistle Coach can't understand words with slides unless it's at the very end. So words like seme and mute are currently not supported, and neither are words that are both past tense and questions.

- Of course you probably should be in an otherwise pretty quiet environment. ~Study areas and libraries usually have great acoustics.~

- If you whistle something that's not recognised as a word, the Whistle Coach tries to find the best match, depending on how close you got to existing words, and if there are multiple candidates, it will pick the most common one.

- The Whistle Coach was developed using the built-in microphone of a laptop for testing, so unless your mic is extra extra bad quality, it should work just fine.

- The Whistle Coach will not save your recordings, not even for training purposes, so don't be shy. The Whistle Coach will \"judge\" you, but it won't \~judge\~ you.

- Can't whistle at all? You don't need to whistle, you can sing, or try to use an instrument if you want. I haven't tried instruments so I don't know if it works. The Whistle Coach is calibrated to my whistle range (300Hz - 4000Hz). You can pick different bounds if you know the frequency range of whatever you're recording. Personally, when I try it with singing, it's really confronting. Whistle Coach is like oh ok i see, lots of key changes. I don't know if this is universal but my whistle is clearly a lot more steady than my voice.
